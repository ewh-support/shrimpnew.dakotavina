<p><span style="font-size:14px">At the time, Taiwan was one of the leading shrimp farming countries in the world, but when whitespot hit, it fell off the shrimp-farming map. &nbsp;After the Taiwan epidemic, whitespot jumped borders and crossed oceans to affect shrimp farms worldwide. &nbsp;In 1992, Thailand faced a devastating loss to whitespot, and in 1993 China&rsquo;s production plummeted from 207,000 metric tons the previous year to 88,000 tons, resulting in the first worldwide decline in shrimp production, market shortages and record prices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Then, in early 1999, whitespot crossed the Pacific Ocean to Central America and subsequently to Ecuador, Brazil, Mexico and the United States.&nbsp; The most likely mode of transmission was processing plant wastes containing infective viral material from frozen Asian shrimp processed in the Americas.&nbsp; No country, however, has ever definitively identified the source of its whitespot epidemic.&nbsp; Theories include transmission by birds, bait shrimp, wild shrimp, shipments of raw and frozen shrimp, trade in shrimp broodstock and postlarvae, shrimp feed, weather and currents&mdash;and even the ballast water in ships.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Whitespot slowed the growth of shrimp farming worldwide for nearly a decade, caused multi-billion dollar losses and eventually spread to every major shrimp-farming country in the world&mdash;except Australia, probably because of the&nbsp;Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service&rsquo;s&nbsp;strict import restrictions on raw and cooked shrimp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In April 2010, Biosecurity Australia beefed up its quarantine rules in a bid to mitigate the risk of importing whitespot and other shrimp diseases.&nbsp; The new rules included mandatory testing samples of imports sourced from parts of the world that had whitespot and other shrimp diseases that Australia did not have.&nbsp; A ban was also imposed on imported uncooked shrimp being used for bait.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">On September 3, 2010, however, a few months after the new rules took effect, the Biosecurity Services Group mistakenly released an infected 20-metric-ton shrimp shipment from Malaysia.&nbsp; They were released despite having tested positive results for whitespot&mdash;something that was only discovered about three weeks later.&nbsp; A subsequent review found there was an extremely low likelihood that infected shrimp would end up in so-called &ldquo;high-risk pathways&rdquo; and cause a whitespot outbreak.&nbsp; It said that most of the consignment would likely end up on dinner plates, and that it was unlikely to be use as bait.&nbsp;Some of those shrimp, however, were fed to broodstock at a hatchery in Darwin, setting off what was until this month Australia&rsquo;s closest encounter with whitespot.&nbsp; The shrimp had been imported for human consumption, but were deemed to be of poor quality, so they were repackaged with their labeling removed and resold on the bait market.&nbsp; When it emerged that the infected consignment had been fed to broodstock at the Darwin hatchery, it sparked a national emergency response by biosecurity officials.&nbsp; All of the exposed broodstock were destroyed, but whitespot was detected in mud crabs near the hatchery&rsquo;s outlet channel.&nbsp; But luck was on Australia&rsquo;s side. &nbsp;In June 2000, 12 shrimp farms were checked for whitespot and none of them were positive.&nbsp; A survey showed whitespot was not present in Australia.</span></p>
