<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Optimum soil characteristics</strong><br />
The soils with moderately heavy texture (sandy clay, sandy clay loam&nbsp;and clay loam), electrical conductivity value of 4 dS m-1 or more, pH ranging &nbsp;between 6.5 and 7.5, organic carbon content of 1.5 to 2% and calcium&nbsp;carbonate content of more than 5% are best suited for shrimp aquaculture. &nbsp;<br />
<strong>Water quality requirements</strong><br />
Water quality and quantity determines the success or failure of an aquaculture operation. an annual water budget should be calculated for a&nbsp;potential farm site so that the supply is adequate for existing and future&nbsp;needs. Water should be free from pesticides and heavy metals. Maintenance&nbsp;of good water quality is essential for both survival and optimum growth of&nbsp;animals. Water treatment is an important step during pond preparation&nbsp;for the maintenance ofgood &nbsp;water quality at later stage.&nbsp;<br />
<strong>Pond preparation</strong><br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pond&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;drying:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Following the harvest after a &nbsp;crop, the deposits of organic debris in the pond&nbsp;bottom should be&nbsp;removed or treated,&nbsp;ploughed, tilled and&nbsp;levelled. all parts&nbsp;of ponds should&nbsp;be thoroughly sun&nbsp;dried for at least three weeks for&nbsp;microbial decomposition of soil&nbsp;organic matter and mineralization of organic nutrients.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Inadequately dried ponds are most likely to develop white spot&nbsp;disease (WSD), running mortality syndrome (RMS)&nbsp;and white gut diseases and premature harvest, whereas, the farms dried from&nbsp;30 to 45 days would often have successful harvest.<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Lime&nbsp;application&nbsp;can&nbsp;be&nbsp;done&nbsp;based&nbsp;on&nbsp;the&nbsp;pH&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;soil&nbsp;and&nbsp;the&nbsp;type of lime available. in soils with chronically low pH it may be beneficial&nbsp;to apply half the total dosage before slight tilling in order to neutralize&nbsp;underlying soil layers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; After&nbsp;emergency&nbsp;harvest&nbsp;due&nbsp;to&nbsp;white&nbsp;spot&nbsp;disease:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Do not discharge water from white spot disease (WSD) affected ponds. Remove aeration devices and implements and disinfect by&nbsp;evenly distributing calcium hypochlorite to provide a minimum final&nbsp;free chlorine concentration of 10&nbsp;ppm. allow the system to stand for&nbsp;a minimum of 24&ndash;48 hours at this minimal chlorine concentration.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The virus may remain infective as many as 26 days or more in&nbsp;the pond sediment despite sun-drying, in ponds harvested on&nbsp;emergency due to WSD. Drying pond sediment for at least three&nbsp;to four weeks can help in prevention of WSD.&nbsp;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Source&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;water:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Filter source water first through coarse screens to remove larger&nbsp;aquatic animals and debris and then pump into a supply/settling&nbsp;canal for allowing the suspended particles in the source water to&nbsp;settle before pumping the water into&nbsp;culture ponds. Then, pass the&nbsp;water through a series of progressively finer screens (150&ndash;250 &mu;m mesh size) before being introduced into the reservoir.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;Chlorinate water in the reservoir with sufficient chlorine (10 ppm)&nbsp;to kill any potential vectors or carriers in the source&nbsp;water collected&nbsp;in the reservoir. For one ha reservoir pond of one meter depth, 150-160 kg of calcium&nbsp;hypochlorite providing 65% active chlorine would &nbsp;give a final concentration of 10 ppm. Vigorously aerate reservoir at&nbsp;least 48 h for de-chlorination to remove residual chlorine.<br />
<strong>Soil and water management</strong><br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; In&nbsp;order&nbsp;to&nbsp;understand&nbsp;the&nbsp;condition&nbsp;of&nbsp;the&nbsp;pond&nbsp;bottom,&nbsp;soil&nbsp;pH,&nbsp;organic matter and redox-potential (Eh) for oxidized/reduced pond&nbsp;bottom condition have to be monitored regularly. The Eh of pond&nbsp;sediment should not exceed -200 mV.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><img alt="" src="/img/loc-nuoc.jpg" /></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;water&nbsp;parameters&nbsp;that&nbsp;should&nbsp;be&nbsp;monitored&nbsp;routinely&nbsp;in&nbsp;ponds&nbsp;during culture period are temperature, pH, salinity, dissolved oxygen&nbsp;and transparency.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pH should be in optimum level of 7.5 to 8.5 and should not&nbsp;vary more than 0.5 in a day.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Variations in salinity not exceeding 5 ppt in a day will help in&nbsp;reducing stress on the shrimp. &nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The optimum range of transparency is 25-35 cm. Transparency&nbsp;can be measured using secchi disc<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The un-ionized form of ammonia nitrogen should be less than&nbsp;0.1 ppm.&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Any detectable concentration of hydrogen sulphide is considered&nbsp;undesirable.&nbsp;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Periodical&nbsp;water&nbsp;exchange&nbsp;as&nbsp;and&nbsp;when&nbsp;required&nbsp;will&nbsp;help&nbsp;in&nbsp;maintaining&nbsp;the water quality in optimal range. The use of aerators results in mixing&nbsp;of water at surface and bottom and breakdowns the DO and thermal&nbsp;stratification.&nbsp;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Use&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;of&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;inputs&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;without&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;proven&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;efficiency&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;should&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;be&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;strictly&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;avoided.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; The&nbsp;discharge&nbsp;water&nbsp;from&nbsp;the&nbsp;shrimp&nbsp;ponds&nbsp;has&nbsp;to&nbsp;be&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;into&nbsp;a&nbsp;treatment system pond before letting it into the environment so that&nbsp;the suspended solids may settle at the bottom.</span></p>
