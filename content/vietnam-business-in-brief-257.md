<p><span style="font-size:14px">The southernmost province of Ca Mau is calling for investment in two tourism projects worth VND1.2 trillion (US$52.7 million) in Dat Mui (Cape Ca Mau) tourism area in Ngoc Hien District, and along the Trem River in Thoi Binh district.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The locality aims to attract more than 50 investment projects in 2017-2020, including ten foreign-invested ones, focusing on seaport development, wind and solar power production and hi-tech industries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Ca Mau has potential for tourism development, boasting many attractive tourism destinations, national-level relic sites, ecological and community-based tourism sites.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">It has pristine natural scenery, with vast green cajeput and mangrove forests, the most famous being U Minh and Nam Can forests.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Eight rivers flow through the province, forming a network of more than 7,000km of rivers and canals with unique beauty and diverse cuisines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The must-see destination in the province is Dat Mui in Mui Hamlet, Dat Mui Commune, Ngoc Hien district, which aims to greet 1 million visitors by 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The cape is home to mangrove forests featuring a plethora of birds, wild animals and fish as well as untouched landscapes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In the first two quarters of this year, Ca Mau welcomed 600,000 tourists, 53.6% of the yearly target.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">It aims to serve more than 1.7 million holidaymakers a year, including 50,000 foreigners, by 2020.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Farmers lose billions as rains kill fish</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Hundreds of tonnes of fish raised in the rivers of Ph&uacute; Thọ, Ph&uacute; Y&ecirc;n and B&igrave;nh Thuận provinces died recently because of floodwater discharge and changes in water quality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Around 350 of the 1,000 tonnes of fish that were being bred in the stretch of Đ&agrave; River in the northern province of Ph&uacute; Thọ had died by Saturday, accroding to intitial statistics from Ph&uacute; Thọ Province&rsquo;s fishery department.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">As a result, households in Thanh Thủy and Thanh Sơn districts have incurred losses worth billions of đồng, as per estimates made by the province&rsquo;s sub-department of fisheries, local media reported.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Out of the 200 affected fish cages in the two districts, 133 cages lost all fish. The remaining 67 cages lost 30 to 70 per cent of the fish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The incident reportedly occurs following the H&ograve;a B&igrave;nh hydropower plant discharging floodwater to its reservoir last Tuesday.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Farmer Dương Tiến Dũng from Thanh Thủy District&rsquo;s Xu&acirc;n Lộc Commune said Đ&agrave; River started flowing faster and changing from a clear green to opaque red on Tuesday night.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">By Thursday, the fish had started becoming disoriented and breathing through their mouths, and died, he said.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The central Ph&uacute; Y&ecirc;n Province on Sunday reported that 40 to 80 per cent of grouper and red tilapia fish being raised in 400 cages in &Ocirc; Loan lagoon had died. Provincial authorities had collected water samples from the lagoon for investigation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Farmers in the area are trying to save the remaining fish by reducing the number of fish in each cage and bathing them in cold water, but so far, it does not seem to have helped much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Also on Sunday, the People&rsquo;s Committee of Đồng Ph&uacute; District in the southern B&igrave;nh Phước Province reported that 90 per cent of the fish being bred by 40 households in Suối Giai Lake had died. Farmer Trần Văn Nhu from the district&rsquo;s T&acirc;n Lập Commune is among the worst hit, having lost five tonnes of mature redtail catfish, worth half a billion đồng.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The mash fish death was likely caused by high levels of aluminium and lack of oxygen in the water as a result of heavy, continuous rainfall, the commune&rsquo;s People&rsquo;s Committee said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Many farmers have been forced to sell their fish at much lower prices because of the mass deaths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Majority of the affected farmers in these provinces hail from poor households and have borrowed money from banks to breed fish.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Further investigations are underway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Sacombank to recoup 20 trillion VND of bad debts in 2017</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Sai Gon Thuong Tin Commercial Joint Stock Bank (Sacombank) aims to tackle 20 trillion VND (880 million USD) of bad debts in 2017, with the bank taking drastic measures to implement a restructuring scheme, said its chairman Duong Cong Minh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Minh believed that bad debt settlement will be effective due to upbeat signs in the property market, the National Assembly&rsquo;s legal provisions for bad debts and the bank&rsquo;s restructuring project.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The bank&rsquo;s profit before taxes was estimated at 428 billion VND (18.8 million USD) in the first half of the year, up 70.4 percent year-on-year, according to the bank&rsquo;s report. Its total assets stood at nearly 353 trillion VND (15.5 billion USD).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">During the first six months, customer lending and capital mobilised from individuals and economic organisations exceeded 212 trillion VND (9.3 billion USD) and 317 trillion VND (13.9 billion USD), up 10.1 percent and 9.7 percent from the outset of the year, respectively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The bank tackled 845 billion VND (37.2 million USD) of non-performing loans in the period and bought back 247 billion VND (10.9 million USD) in non-performing loans from the Vietnam Asset Management Company.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Chairman Minh shared the bank&rsquo;s restructuring scheme, including shaking up bank organisation and human resources and re-arranging transaction networks and branches was based on the strategy &ldquo;developing rural areas to support urban zones&rdquo;.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Last month, Sacombank held its annual general meeting of shareholders for the fiscal year 2015-2016. Minh was elected as Chairman of the Board of Directors for the term 2017-2021 and Nguyen Duc Thach Diem as Standing Director General.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Green tax hike on petrol</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is going ahead with its plan to increase environmental protection tax on petroleum from the current VND1,000-4,000 to VND3,000-8,000 per litre, despite objections from other ministries and the public.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In its second draft of the Law on Environmental Protection Taxes announced last week, the ministry proposed a tax hike on fuel consumption of VND3,000-6,000 per litre for aviation fuel, VND1,500-4,000 per litre for diesel, VND300-2,000 per litre for kerosene, and VND900-4,000 per kg for mazut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">If the new tax rate is applied, the price of gasoline at the pumps will rise to around VND22,000 (roughly US$1) per litre from the average price at the pump of around VND16,000 to VND17,000 for petrol and VND10,000 to VND11,000 for diesel and mazut, respectively, analysts said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Ministry of Transport (MoT) told the Ministry of Finance (MoF) that Viet Nam would apply two petroleum quality standards based on the Euro 2 and Euro 4 emission standards, suggesting that the MoF set a lower environmental protection tax for Euro 4, which cleans emissions from diesel cars, to encourage the production of more eco-friendly petroleum.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Viet Nam National Petroleum Group (Petrolimex) said the calculation of environmental protection tax on fuel should encourage E5 bio-fuel consumption.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Viet Nam Petroleum Association (VINPA) has supported the MoF&rsquo;s tax proposal, though it has pointed out that the maximum tax of VND8,000 per litre is too high.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The VINPA has suggested that the MoF hike environmental protection tax from the current VND3,000 to VND5,000 per litre for petrol; from VND1,500 to VND3,000 per litre for diesel; from VND3,000 to VND5,000 per litre for aviation fuel; and from VND900 to VND3,000 per kg for mazut.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Earlier, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the MoF should carefully consider its tax hike proposal as local businesses, which are already paying many kinds of taxes and fees, will be further hit. It asked the MoF to do an assessment on the impact of the tax hike on the economy and people&rsquo;s lives.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The draft law is scheduled to be submitted to the Finance-State Budget Committee of the National Assembly (NA) for consideration this month. It will be submitted to the NA Standing Committee in August, and to NA deputies in September. The NA will review the draft law for approval in October.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">MoF&rsquo;s deputy minister Tran Xuan Ha said the tax hike is one of the measures to better manage petroleum products while limiting smuggling. Its impact on businesses, people and inflation will be calculated, he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Last year, around VND42.3 trillion ($1.9 billion) was collected in environmental protection tax, of which petroleum raked in VND40.2 trillion.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Major start-up conference, exhibit opens in Da Nang</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">More than 2,000 businesses, speakers and students joined the second International Start-up Conference and Exhibition in the central city yesterday, sharing experiences and ideas in panel and round-table discussions, talks and fireside charts among domestic and international experts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The event, entitled Surf-the Start-up Wave 2017, also featured local government leaders, partners, investment funds, investors, entrepreneurs, enterprises, start-up support organisations, authorities, students from universities and residents from Ha Noi, HCM City, Hue, Quang Nam, Binh Dinh, Can Tho, Dong Thap, Da Nang and representatives from 27 countries and territories.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Da Nang has launched its business start-up programme eco-system from now until 2020, with a vistion to 2030.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&ldquo;We are looking to make the city into a start-up destination and international innovation hub of ASEAN in 2030. The 2017 International Start-up Conference and Exhibition will be a significant chance for the city and partners forming development of the city&rsquo;s start-up ecosystem in the future,&rdquo; said chairman of Da Nang&rsquo;s Start-up Network Council and Da Nang Business Incubator, Vo Duy Khuong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s also an opportunity for young businesses in Da Nang seeking fund investors,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The event drew the participation of 70 pavilions from start-up projects and businesses, institutes, colleges and sponsors in panel discussions, roundtables, pitching competitions, and exhibitions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Motivational speaker Jeff Hoffman, the cofounder of Priceline.com and of ColorJar, also shared experience and suggestion for young start-up businesses during the two-day event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Earlier this year, the city and the Ireland Embassy in Viet Nam agreed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on high quality human resource education, management skills for the city&rsquo;s personnel and start-up programme for students in Da Nang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The MoU will include Master Education programme, education exchange among Da Nang&rsquo;s Economics College and Iris universities and humanitarian programme in supporting the disabled persons in Da Nang.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Cait Moran, Ambassador of Ireland to Viet Nam, said Ireland looks forward to a burgeoning partnership with Da Nang City.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">She said the MoU aims to boost the relationship between Ireland and the central city and foster co-operation between Da Nang with locals and cities in Ireland.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Participants also focussed on the start-up ecosystem, support policies and investment as well as sharing experience and technology.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The conference, which was sponsored by the Asia Development Bank, the Mekong Business Initiative, Swiss EP and the Innovation Partnership Programme in Viet Nam, will close today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Last year, the central city&rsquo;s Song Han Incubator launched a tourism start-up programme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Da Nang has 18,000 businesses, 95 per cent of which are small and medium-sized enterprises.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Bac Giang to revoke slow-moving investment projects in its city</strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The northern province of Bac Giang plans to revoke licences from several investment projects that are moving too slowly, according to the provincial Department of Planning and Investment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">One of the Bac Giang City projects is an expansion of a agricultural processing factory financed by Viet Nga Limited Co. Covering 6,600sq.m in Da Mai District, the VND13.45 billion (US$560,000) plant halted operation since 2012 due to its investor&rsquo;s financial difficulties. The plant will have its investment certificate revoked if the investor fails to resume its operation before November, the department said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The department added it will also request for an approval from the provincial People&rsquo;s Committee to withdraw an investment licence of $17.8 million Ha Noi Prince hotel complex, developed by VINAPROD JSC, in Xuong Giang Street. The complex&rsquo;s investor has yet to kick off the complex after receiving the licence in 2007.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Two other slow-moving projects - the Thang Long private school project invested by Duc Tri Education JSC and Anh Hong commercial and service complex fianced by Anh Hong Co - have received similar warnings from the department.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The city is currently home to 250 projects, including 29 foreign-invested, with a combined investment capital of more than $1 billion, department statistics reveal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Bac Giang Province will create conditions to encourage businesses to boost investment, compensate for land clearance and hasten infrastructure construction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">It will enhance administrative transparency and strictly punish officials hampering enterprises.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Along with supporting investors in land clearance, the province promises to maintain dialogues with investors to address difficulties.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Vietnam&rsquo;s tra fish among top-quality items at Japan Aeon supermarkets</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Vietnam&rsquo;s tra fish sold at Aeon supermarkets in Japan is listed among &ldquo;TopValu&rdquo; products which are goods with leading quality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Keisuke Hino, who manages AEON&rsquo;s aquatic products section in the northern Kanto and Niigata region, said to meet TopValu standards, products must satisfy consumers&rsquo; taste and be made in line with AEON&rsquo;s strict process.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Vietnamese tra fish product made with the recipe of the eel dish &ndash; a traditional food of Japan in summer &ndash; has been sold at AEON supermarkets since June, and the retailing group plans to expand the sale of this product in the future, he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Ta Duc Minh, Trade Counsellor and chief representative of Vietnam&rsquo;s Industry and Trade Ministry in Japan, said Vietnam&rsquo;s tra fish exports to Japan approximated 14 million USD in 2016 and 7 million USD in the first five months of 2017.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">He added to boost the shipments of tra fish to Japan, it is very important to ensure food safety and align fish farming, packaging and labeling activities with Japanese standards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Aside from tra fish, bananas, mangoes and red-flesh dragon fruits are considered strategic goods helping to increase the two countries&rsquo; trade revenue.-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Dong Nai builds over 30 large-scale fields</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development of the southern province of Dong Nai has approved zoning off 31 large-scale fields to cultivate durian, pepper and cocoa in the locality.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Head of the department Nguyen Huu Dinh said the provincial People&rsquo;s Committee has authorised 12 large-scale fields with a total area of 5,5000 hectares and expects to draw the participation of 5,000 local households. Meanwhile, investors will work with local authorities and farmers to assess the remaining 19 projects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The province has carried out large-scale projects, a centralised production model bringing together farmers, businesses, scientists and State agencies to apply technology in farming, since 2014.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Thanks to the model, businesses have secured stable material sources, while famers have grown high-yield crops and improved their incomes, Dinh said, adding that large-scale projects make it easier to transfer science and technology to famers and manage the quality of farm produce.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In carrying out the model, the province invested in infrastructure facilities and provided farmers with 30 percent of seedling and water-saving irrigation system costs, he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The province has also pushed production linkages to develop stable outputs for local agricultural products. Some 13 linking chains have been set up so far, allowing farmers to sell products to businesses above market prices. In addition, they promote sustainable agriculture, applying water-saving irrigation system and fertilising through pipelines.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Mercedes-Benz sales in Vietnam grow by 60 percent in H1</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Mercedes-Benz Vietnam (MBV) reported a year-on-year growth of more than 60 percent in automobile sales during the first half of 2017, the best in 22 years of its presence in Vietnam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The firm sold a total of 2,900 cars during the period in spite of the market fluctuation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">While many automakers are cutting prices for both affordable to luxury models sold in Vietnam to boost demand, the MBV still enjoyed high sales even with its prices ranging from 1.34 billion &ndash; 14.45 billion VND.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The brand also appeared to not be much affected by elimination of Vietnam&rsquo;s import tariff on ASEAN-made vehicles in early 2018 following the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">According to the MBV, since the beginning of this year, the company has received over 100 orders for luxury model Mercedes-Maybach, with half of them delivered. The new-generation E-Class also saw a good sale with more than 600 units sold since its debut in late 2016.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Vietnam, Laos work closely to promote trade</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Since Vietnam and Laos set up diplomatic relations in 1962, the relationship between the two countries has flourished thanks to efforts from both sides to make ties deeper and more effective, especially in economy, trade and investment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">According to Deputy Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Quoc Khanh, since a bilateral trade agreement was signed in March 3, 2015 and a border trade agreement was inked on June 26, 2015, trade ties between the two countries have developed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Launching the Vietnam-Lao trade website at www.vietlaotrade.com has also fostered connections and trade exchange between business communities of both sides.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Deputy Minister Khanh said the website aims to provide the business community timely and comprehensive information on economic, trade, industry regulations, mechanisms and policies as well as trade promotion activities, aiming to better serve enterprises of both countries and make information cheaper to access.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Statistics of the Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT) showed that as of March 2017, trade between the two countries reached 236 million USD, up 4.3 percent year on year, with Vietnam&rsquo;s exports at 135 million USD, a rise of 22.6 percent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Meanwhile, Vietnam imported 101 million USD worth of goods from Laos, down 13.1 percent over the same period last year, resulting in a trade surplus of 34 million USD for Vietnam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Vietnam mostly exported fuel, steel, iron, transportation vehicles and spare parts to Laos, while importing rubber, fertiliser, ore and minerals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">To celebrate the 55th anniversary of Vietnam-Laos diplomatic relations and 40 years of the Vietnam-Laos Treaty of Amity and Cooperation, a trade fair was held from June 29-July 3 in Vientiane to encourage stronger economic, trade and investment cooperation between the two countries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Meanwhile, two-way trade between Vietnam and Laos dropped about 20 percent in 2016, mostly because the Government of Laos stopped exporting woods and minimised imports of some products the country can supply itself such as cement, iron and steel. Trade competition in Laos has also become fiercer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Recently, Minister of Industry and Trade Tran Tuan Anh had a meeting with Lao Minister of Industry and Commerce Khemmany Phonexena to discuss the fall in trade and seek measures to promote bilateral trade.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The two sides have agreed to work closely in building a bilateral trade development plan for the next 10 years, and to strengthen communications on the bilateral trade and border trade agreements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">To fulfil the target of 4 billion USD in two-way trade in 2020, the two sides will launch new cooperation projects in Laos and assist existing projects, while carrying out the agreement on border and border gate management and the protocol on borderline and national border markers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The MoIT will also review Vietnamese projects in Laos to seek measures to support investors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Reference exchange rate goes down 3 VND at week&rsquo;s beginning</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The State Bank of Vietnam announced its reference VND/USD exchange rate at 22,429 VND/USD on July 24, down 3 VND from the end of last week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">With the current /- 3 percent VND/USD trading band, the ceiling exchange rate is 23,102 VND per USD and the floor rate is 21,756 VND per USD.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Major commercial banks kept their rates stable at the opening hours.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Vietcombank offered 22,700 VND (buying) and 22,770 VND (selling), per USD, unchanged from the end of last week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">BIDV also posted the same rates as Vietcombank&rsquo;s, with 22,700 VND (buying) and 22,770 VND (selling), per USD, also unchanged from the end of last week.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Techcombank kept its buying and selling rates unchanged from July 21 at 22,685 VND and 22,780 VND.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Australia partially ends probe against Vietnam&rsquo;s zinc coated steel</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Anti-Dumping Commission (ADC) under the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science of Australia has announced the partial rescission of its anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigation on Vietnamese zincs coated (galvanised) steel.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Among the countries under the ADC&rsquo;s probe, which also looked into zincs coated steel imported from India and Malaysia, only Vietnam gets the partial termination.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">According to the Vietnamese Ministry of Industry and Trade (MoIT), the ADC concluded that Vietnamese galvanised steel producers and exporters received countervailable subsidies from the Government during the investigation period but the subsidies never exceeded the negligible level.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Therefore, the ADC decided to terminate the anti-subsidy investigation against all Vietnamese galvanised steel producers and exporters.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Besides, the commission will not give any recommendations about subsidies for Vietnam in its final report to the Minister for Industry, Innovation and Science.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The investigation also found that two out of the three Vietnamese producers and exporters who fully cooperated with Australian investigators had the dumping range lower than the minimal level. Hence, the commission has terminated the investigation into the two companies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The MoIT said that, the Australian commission took into account complaints from concerned parties, the statement of essential facts (SEF), comments relating to the SEF and information it received from the investigation process to make the decision.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Parties may seek a review of the decision by lodging an application with the Anti-Dumping Review Panel within 30 days of publication of the notice.-</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>DOC stops anti-dumping investigation against VN polyester fibre</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The US Department of Commerce (DOC) has announced the termination of anti-dumping investigation on polyester fibre imported from Vietnam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Earlier, on June 20, DOC officially initiated the investigation on polyester fibre imported from Vietnam, China, India, the Republic of Korea and Taiwan (China) based on petitions filed by DAK Americas LLC; Nan Ya Plastics Corporation, and Augira Polymers.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The plaintiffs alleged that polyester staple fibre products are being shipped to the US at prices lower than their normal value. In addition, dumping has caused significant damage to the domestic industry due to price depression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The scope of these investigations covers fine denier polyester staple fibre, not carded or combed, measuring less than 3.3 decitex in diameter, coded HS: 5503.20.0025.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Binh Thuan looks to expand VietGap dragon fruit area</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">A conference discussing ways to expand the area of dragon fruit meeting Vietnamese Good Agricultural Practice (VietGAP) standards in the central Binh Thuan province was held in the locality on July 21.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">According to the provincial People&rsquo;s Committee, Binh Thuan has more 27,000 ha of dragon fruit (up 135 ha compared to the end of 2016), with a total productivity of 277,000 tonnes per year. The area of dragon fruit meeting VietGAP standards accounts for 28.27 percent or 7,680 ha.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The VietGap dragon fruit cultivation model in Binh Thuan is practised by over 9,000 local farmers, who have formed 382 cooperatives and farms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In the first six months of this year, 75 cooperatives and farmers&rsquo; groups were assessed and granted with VietGAP certificates, with a total area of 1,442 ha, including 1,100 ha being re-certified.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Participants to the conference said the cultivation of dragon fruit in line with VietGAP standards has contributed to changing farming practices of local farmers, thus improving the quality and prestige of the products as well as promoting export.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">However, the provincial Department of Agriculture and Rural Development said the expansion of VietGAP cultivation area is slow, with less farmers seeking re-certification. The department attributed this to the fact that few enterprises are interested in purchasing safe dragon fruits, while local authorities failed to pay adequate attention to promoting the production model.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Vice Chairman of the provincial People&rsquo;s Committee Pham Van Nam asked the local agriculture sector to cooperate with relevant sectors to raise public awareness of the importance of producing clean farm products, including dragon fruit.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">He also urged the sector to work with the provincial Department of Industry and Trade and the Association of Dragon Fruit to build production chains, and encourage enterprises to cooperate with cooperatives in selling VietGap-dragon fruits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Binh Thuan dragon fruit is exported to 20 countries and territories, including demanding markets like the US and Europe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The locality aims to have 9,700 ha of dragon fruit meeting VietGAP standards.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Vietnam exports 2.66 mln tonnes of rice in first half</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Vietnam exported nearly 2.66 million tonnes of rice in the first half this year with free-on-board value of 1.65 billion USD, reported the Vietnam Food Association.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The figures were up 0.25 percent in volume and 1.85 percent in value, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The growth was attributed to increased demand and limited supply. Notably, japonica rice export saw the highest increase by around 300 percent year-on-year, accounting for 4.57 percent of Vietnam&rsquo;s total rice export compared to around 1 percent in late 2015.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Japonica rice was shipped mostly to Australia, making up 5.24 percent of market share.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">However, Vietnamese rice was predominantly delivered to Asia (about 70 percent), including China (43.8 percent), the Philippines, Malaysia and Singapore.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Premium white rice, glutinous and broken rice shipments also went up 34 percent, 51 percent and 127 percent, respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Among exported rice in the six months, jasmine rice made up 28.8 percent, followed by premium white rice (28.6 percent).&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Dak Lak province came second in the number of tourists, thanks to unique attractions such as elephant riding, rowing a dugout canoe in Lak River, Don Village, and gong performance by ethnic minority artists.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Along with promoting its strength in diverse terrain and rich culture heritage of ethnic minority groups, the Central Highlands region is also investing in building tourist sites and expanding transportation system serving tourism.</span></p>
