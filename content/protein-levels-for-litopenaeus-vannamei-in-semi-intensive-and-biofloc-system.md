<p><span style="font-size:14px">Four different diets, with crude protein (CP) contents of 24.3, 30.3, 32.9 and 36.7% were produced. In the laboratory, experimental culture in the biofloc system was performed in twelve experimental units at a density of 250 shrimp m&minus; 3, the four treatments were performed in triplicate. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The semi-intensive culture system was applied at the commercial farm in eleven ponds containing 15.5 shrimp m&minus; 2. After 49 days, the zootechnical performance of the shrimp was rated, and the cost per kilogram of shrimp was produced by both culture systems. In the semi-intensive system, the shrimp fed with a diet containing 32.9% CP showed a higher final weight and weight gain and a lower dietary cost. In the biofloc culture, a higher final weight, weight gain, growth rate and productivity were observed in shrimp fed diets containing 30.3, 32.9 and 36.7% CP compared with those fed a diet containing 24.3% CP. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The lowest dietary cost of shrimp farming in the biofloc system was registered in the shrimp fed the 30.3% CP diet, whereas, in the semi-intensive system, the highest final weight, highest weight gain and lowest cost were observed in shrimp fed the 32.9% CP diet.</span></p>
