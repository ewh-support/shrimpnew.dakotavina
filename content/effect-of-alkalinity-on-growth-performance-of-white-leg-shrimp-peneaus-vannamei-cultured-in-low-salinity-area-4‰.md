<p><span style="font-size:14px">White leg shrimp (Penaeus vannamei) were acclimated to low salinity (4&permil;) before&nbsp;starting experiment. There are four treatments with different amount of alkalinity such as 40;&nbsp;60; 80 and 100 mg CaCO3/L and each of treatment has three replicates.<br />
After eight weeks, result of experiment was obtained by the same as growth&nbsp;performance&rsquo;s white leg shrimp among treatments, with final length was measured from 8.78-&nbsp;9.13 cm, final weight was measured from 4.93-5.45 g/shrimp, daily weigh gain was gained&nbsp;0.087-0.096 g/day, survival rate was fluctuated between 68.3 and 77.5%, food conversion rate&nbsp;was spent from 1.16 to1.50 and feed intake was consumed from 0.11 to 0.13 g/day.<br />
To conclude, concentration of alkalinity ranged from 40 to 100 mg CaCO3/L did not&nbsp;affect on growth performance, survival rate and feed efficiency. Therefore, white leg shrimp&nbsp;could still grow and develop well in low salinity area (4&permil;) with low alkalinity (&ge;40 mg&nbsp;CaCO3/L).</span></p>
