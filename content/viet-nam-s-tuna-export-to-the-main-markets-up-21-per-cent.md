<p><span style="font-size:14px">Currently, Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna products have been exported to 97 nations and territories. Top 8 of Viet Nam tuna importers were the U.S, EU, Israel, ASEAN, Japan, Canada, China and Mexico, accounting for 88 per cent of the country&rsquo;s total tuna export value in the first six months of this year. Of which, tuna export to Mexico saw a strongest growth rate of 125 per cent, making it surpass Canada and China to become 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;largest tuna importer of Viet Nam&rsquo;s fisheries.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>U.S</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export to the U.S saw a slight decline in the first two months of this year; however, it witnessed a recovery in the second quarter. Viet Nam&rsquo;s total tuna export value to the U.S in the first six months of this year gained US$ 108 million, increasing by 16 per cent compared to the same period last year. As of the end of June, Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export to the U.S continued increasing year on year. Frozen fillet/loin tuna was the key item exported to the market, accounting for 60 per cent of Viet Nam&rsquo;s total tuna export value to the U.S. Meanwhile, Viet Nam&rsquo;s processed and canned tuna to the U.S continued to rise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>EU</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Tuna export to EU market continued seeing a recovery with export value in the first 6 months of this year reaching US$ 58 million, an increase of 14 per cent compared to the same period last year. Frozen loin/fillet tuna continued to be the Viet Nam&rsquo;s key export items on this market, accounting for 40 per cent of Viet Nam&rsquo;s total tuna export to the market, which was followed by canned tuna, occupying for 34 per cent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Notably, exports of Viet Nam&rsquo;s fresh/live/frozen tuna saw an increase while that of other processed tuna products to the market continued to drop compared to the same period last year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Japan</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">In the first 6 months of this year, tuna export to Japan saw a positive growth, with export value reaching US$ 10.6 million, an increase of 22.5 per cent compared to the same period last year. Of this figure, processed and canned tuna products accounted for 55 per cent, up 39 per cent compared to the same period last year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>ASEAN</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Tuna export to ASEAN witnessed a mixed trend. In the first 6 months of this year, tuna export to the market gained US$ 19 million, reducing 9 per cent compared to the same period last year. A reduction in canned tuna export, especially other processed tuna products such as steamed tuna and flake tuna was a reason for a decline in Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export to ASEAN market in the first 6 months of this year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px"><strong>Outlook</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">It is expected that tuna production in the next coming months would see a slight reduction. Besides, demand of tuna in the main import markets such as the U.S and EU would be affected due to high price of tuna on the world market. As a result, the growth rate of Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export to these markets would be in slow. However, Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export to other markets such as Israel, Mexico and Canada is expected to increase, which would lead to a rise in Viet Nam&rsquo;s tuna export in the coming time.</span></p>
