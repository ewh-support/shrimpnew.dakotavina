<p>SUMMARY<br />
However, to control CAP absence in&nbsp;local farming still remain an open issue.Thus, research on elimination of CAP residues in<br />
shrimp muscle (Penaeus monodon ) were conducted to help manager and farmer use&nbsp;antibiotics efficiently. Muscle residue depletion of CAP following oral administration was&nbsp;evaluated in shrimp under experimental conditions.</p>

<p>Four groups of shrimps were cultured in&nbsp;pond and fed a commercial medicated diet containing 2000 mg/kg. Sampling was conducted&nbsp;at different intervals (1, 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120 h) after the cossation of medication. Drug&nbsp;analysis was carried out by LC/MS/MS, and LOQ of method was 0,03 ng/g. The&nbsp;concentration of CAP after 60-h post-dosing are undetectable (&lt;0,3 ng/g). So, it is not used in&nbsp;mucle residue depletion of CAP analysis. The elimination half-life (t1/2) of CAP was 13,5 h.</p>
