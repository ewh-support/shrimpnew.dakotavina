<p><span style="font-size:14px">&nbsp;To ensure sustainability of the shrimp industry, production capacity and disease outbreak prevention must be improved. Understanding healthy microbial balance inside the shrimp intestine can provide an initial step toward better farming practice and probiotic applications. In this study, we employed a barcode pyrosequencing analysis of V3-4 regions of 16S rRNA genes to examine intestinal bacteria communities in wild-caught and domesticated&nbsp;<em>P. monodon</em>&nbsp;broodstock. Shrimp faeces were removed from intestines prior to further analysis in attempt to identify mucosal bacterial population. Five phyla,&nbsp;<em>Actinobacteria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Fusobacteria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Proteobacteria</em>,&nbsp;<em>Firmicutes</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Bacteroidetes,</em>&nbsp;were found in all shrimp from both wild and domesticated environments. The operational taxonomic unit (OTU) was assigned at 97% sequence identity, and our pyrosequencing results identified 18 OTUs commonly found in both groups. Sequences of the shared OTUs were similar to bacteria in three phyla, namely&nbsp;<em>i) Proteobacteria</em>&nbsp;(<em>Vibrio</em>,&nbsp;<em>Photobacterium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Novosphingobium</em>,&nbsp;<em>Pseudomonas</em>,&nbsp;<em>Sphingomonas</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Undibacterium</em>),&nbsp;<em>ii) Firmicutes</em>&nbsp;(<em>Fusibacter</em>), and&nbsp;<em>iii) Bacteroidetes</em>&nbsp;(<em>Cloacibacterium</em>). The shared bacterial members in&nbsp;<em>P. monodon</em>&nbsp;from two different habitats provide evidence that the internal environments within the host shrimp also exerts selective pressure on bacterial members. Intestinal bacterial profiles were compared using denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). The sequences from DGGE bands were similar to those of&nbsp;<em>Vibrio</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Photobacterium</em>in all shrimp, consistent with pyrosequencing results. This work provides the first comprehensive report on bacterial populations in the intestine of adult black tiger shrimp and reveals some similar bacterial members between the intestine of wild-caught and domesticated shrimp.</span></p>
