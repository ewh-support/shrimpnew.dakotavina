<p><span style="font-size:14px">Đồng Th&aacute;p authorities released silver barb, red-tailed tinfoil, panga fish and other species which weighed over 600 kilogrammes in total and cost VNĐ130 million (USD 5,720).<br />
The event was organised by the local Department of Agriculture and Rural Development together with the province&rsquo;s Buddhist Sangha. The organisers called for the public&rsquo;s help in preserving and developing aquatic resources.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The province&rsquo;s Fisheries Sub-department has banned fishing in the Tiền River in the vicinity of Sa Đ&eacute;c from September 4 to 9 to protect the newly released fish. According to the sub-department, climate change and excessive fishing mean aquatic resources are unable to regenerate fast enough and have seriously declines, especially rare, valuable species.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Meanwhile, the northern mountainous province of Tuy&ecirc;n Quang has released 1.2 tonnes of baby fish into Lo River, aimed at getting productivity of bred fish back on track.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Co-organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development&rsquo;s Directorate of Fisheries, the province&rsquo;s Agriculture and Rural Development and the Viet Nam Buddhist Church, the aquaculture activities were implemented on Monday (falling on the 14th day &mdash; one day before the seventh lunar month, celebrating the seventh full moon of the year. Releasing fish into the lake is a Vietnamese custom on this occasion).</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">It is one of many measures to develop the fisheries sector towards sustainable and environmental protection carried out by Tuy&ecirc;n Quang Province authorities, following which fishing and aquaculture activities have seen positive changes. Over the last few years, fish and aquaculture sources from L&ocirc; River have been declining, especially indigenous fish species that are in danger of extinction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">During Monday&rsquo;s event, among the 1.2 tonnes of baby fish dropped into the river was a large quantity of two indigenous fish species that are facing extinction and are highly-valued &ndash; carp and rohu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The reproduction of fish and aquatic resources that takes place every year aims to promote awareness and responsibility for the protection of aquatic resources in society. Authorities have called on residents to avoid catching aquatic species during and after the time to stock up baby fish. Through this activity, authorities are hoping organisations and individuals jointly protect and develop fisheries resources.</span></p>
