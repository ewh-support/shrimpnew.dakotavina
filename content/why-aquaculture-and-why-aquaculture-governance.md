<p><span style="font-size:14px">Aquaculture&nbsp;can close this expected gap. Aquaculture also has the potential to&nbsp;eliminate hunger and food and nutrition insecurity, as well as to&nbsp;reduce poverty generally, thereby contributing to the Sustainable&nbsp;Development Goals (SDGs).<br />
Particularly over the last two decades, global production from&nbsp;aquaculture has grown substantially, providing significant volumes&nbsp;of fish and other aquatic food for human consumption, creating&nbsp;substantial employment and reducing poverty, often in remote&nbsp;areas. This trend is projected to continue as aquaculture continues&nbsp;to expand worldwide.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Good governance of aquaculture is a necessary condition for the&nbsp;sector to fully realize its potential for growth. Good governance will&nbsp;also ensure order and sustainability of this growth.&nbsp;Certain characteristics of the sector further justify the need for its&nbsp;governance:<br />
&bull; The risk and uncertainty inherent in a new and rapidly changing&nbsp;sector.<br />
&bull; The comparatively recent &ldquo;emergence&rdquo; of aquaculture, which&nbsp;can create administrative duplication, and legislative vacuums.<br />
&bull; The interdependence with other sectors which often leads to&nbsp;competition with pre-existing sectors for access to productive&nbsp;resources.<br />
&bull; The complexity of aquaculture, partly as a result of the life cycles&nbsp;of aquatic organisms, as well as the management and technical&nbsp;requirements of growing them in captivity.<br />
&bull; The diversity of culture systems, sites, facilities, practices, and&nbsp;processes needed to deliver aquatic products.<br />
&bull; The wide range of political, social, economic and environmental&nbsp;conditions under which production occurs.</span></p>
