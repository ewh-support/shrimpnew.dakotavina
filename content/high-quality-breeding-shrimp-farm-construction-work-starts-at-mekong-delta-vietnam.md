<p>Invested by Viet-Uc Corporation (VUC) at a total cost of VND120 billion (US$5.21 million), the farm will sit on a site of over 23ha in the first stage which will be completed in June 2018, producing around 5 billion breeding shrimps per year and generating jobs to roughly 400 local workers.</p>

<p>The second stage, which will start in late 2018, will extend to more than 60ha.</p>

<p>Luong Thanh Van, Chairman of the VUC Board of Directors and General Director, said VUC has produced about 40 billion breeding shrimps, accounting for 24% of market share nationwide.</p>

<p>It is the VUC&rsquo;s fourth farm in the Mekong Delta and the ninth nationwide, he said.&nbsp;<br />
Tran Van Chuyen, Chairman of the provincial People&rsquo;s Committee, said Soc Trang needs 16 billion &ndash; 18 billion breeding shrimps each year, adding that the project will help cut transportation costs and offer jobs to hundreds of local people.&nbsp;<br />
He pledged all possible support for the project and asked VUC to accelerate the construction.</p>
