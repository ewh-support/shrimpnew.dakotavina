<p>&bull; Vietnam has around 2,300 shrimp hatcheries, concentrated in Ninh Thuan, Binh Thuan, Khanh Hoa, Ca Mau and Bac Lieu provinces.</p>

<p>&bull; Vietnam has about 350 shrimp processing facilities with an annual capacity of more than 1.4 million metric tons a year.</p>

<p>But, according to Le Anh Xuan, Chairman of the Board at NG Vietnam, which farms Penaeus vannamei in Ca Mau Province, Vietnam does not have a consistent supply of good-quality postlarvae for stocking ponds, and the hatchery industry is dependent on wild and imported broodstock.</p>

<p>Tran Dinh Luan, Vietnam&rsquo;s Deputy Director of the Directorate of Fisheries, said the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has established a steering committee to guide the development of a domestic broodstock industry and has created favorable conditions for businesses to become involved in the process. &ldquo;Hopefully, from now to 2020, Vietnam will be able to produce parent shrimp meeting bio-safety requirements and become self-sufficient in this field. This is necessary for Vietnam to raise annual shrimp export value to $10 billion by 2025,&rdquo; Tran Dinh Luan said.</p>
