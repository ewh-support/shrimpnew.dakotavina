<p><span style="font-size:16px">Procedure for Hemocytometer:<br />
1) Wipe the middle part and tunnels, and the cover glass<br />
2) Place the cover glass on the counting cell<br />
3) Stir the sample well with a pipet<br />
4) Fill the pipet with the stirred sample<br />
5) Place the tip on one triangle, and ﬁll that chamber with sample<br />
6) Stir the sample well with a pipet<br />
7) Fill the pipet with the stirred sample<br />
8) Place the tip on second triangle, and ﬁll that chamber with sample<br />
9) Wait for a few minutes to let the algae cells time to settle<br />
10) Position the Hemocytometer to start with the lower chamber, ﬁnd the gridded area&nbsp;(Figure 1) set the microscope to X10<br />
11) Set the counter to Zero (0000)<br />
12) Each chamber had 9 big squares, at total count the algae in each of the 18 squares.Each big square is a 1 mm2<br />
A, B, C, &amp; D - each has 16 middle size squares<br />
Center - has 25 middle size squares<br />
Between A-B, A-D, D-C, &amp; C-B - each has 20 middle size squares</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Figure 1: The&nbsp;gridded area&nbsp;of the hemocytometer<br />
13) Start at block A at the upper left square - its borders on top and left are 3 lines &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
14) While scanning all the middle size squares count all the algae in that big square,&nbsp;<br />
move as in Figure 2</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Figure 2: Direction for counting algae in 1 big square</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">BORDERS - count only algae that are within the big square&rsquo;s border. Each big square is separated from its neighbors by 3 lines. The border is the middle line of those three.<br />
15) Record the number of algae cells on the electronic data sheet<br />
16) Proceed to the square between A-D, than to square D, than to the square between&nbsp;D-C, than to the center, than to the square between A-B, than to square B, than to&nbsp;<br />
the square between B-C, than to square C (Figure 1)<br />
17) Count the algae in each of these big squares, record the number you have reached&nbsp;at the end of each square.<br />
18) When you ﬁnished with the ﬁrst chamber, move to the other one.<br />
19) Record in the lab book the total number of algae cells, the number of big squares&nbsp;you counted and the total volume, and the density of algae cells. In total count at&nbsp;least 100 algae cells!!<br />
20) Rinse the hemocytometer and the cover glass with RO water. Wipe to dry with&nbsp;kimwipe<br />
21) Repeat all steps for a second replica<br />
22) If the difference of algae cells density between the duplicates is to high repeat all&nbsp;<br />
steps for the third replica. Don&rsquo;t count more than 4 replicates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">Procedure for Sedgwick cell: the counting cell is the gridded area<br />
1) Wipe the cell, and the cover glass<br />
2) Stir the sample well with a pipet<br />
3) Fill the pipet with the stirred sample<br />
4) Place the pipet at one corner of the counting cell and start ﬁlling it with the sample&nbsp;moving the pipet toward the other side of the counting cell (start at left bottom corner,&nbsp;move to upper corner and then to the right).<br />
5) Place the cover glass on the counting cell, make sure that the sample ﬁll the entire&nbsp;counting cell&nbsp;without forming air bubbles.<br />
6) Absorb the excess of sample from both sides of the counting cell with a kimwipe.<br />
7) Wait for 5-10 minutes to let the algae cells time to settle<br />
8) Position the Sedgwick cell to start at one of the sides, ﬁnd the grid and set the&nbsp;microscope to X10<br />
9) Set the counter to Zero (0000)<br />
10) The amount of squares need to be counted is determined by the density of algae&nbsp;cells. In total count more than 200 algae cells!! i-very low density (aprox. 5 algae cells&nbsp;in a square): count all squares from left&nbsp;to right, at 3 areas of the counting cell (top,&nbsp;middle and bottom) chose then randomly. ii) medium density (aprox. 20 algae cells in&nbsp;a square): count all squares from top to bottom, at 3 or 4 areas of the counting cell&nbsp;(left, middle and right) chose them randomly. iii) high density (more than 50 algae&nbsp;cells in a square): chose random squares from different areas of the counting cell&nbsp;(make sure not to chose the same cell twice).<br />
11) Start with the ﬁrst square.<br />
12) Count all the algae inside that square.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">13) Record the number of algae cells on the electronic data sheet<br />
14) Proceed to the next square<br />
15) Count the algae in each of these squares, record the number you have reached at&nbsp;the end of each square. even if the number is the same as it was in the former&nbsp;square (e.g. 0 algae).<br />
16) In the electronic data sheet - change the formula of &lsquo; volume counted(ul)&rsquo; =&nbsp;#squares x(1x1x1).<br />
17) Record in the lab book the total number of algae cells, the number of squares you&nbsp;counted and the total volume, and the density of algae cells.&nbsp;<br />
18) Rinse the Sedgwik cell and the cover glass with RO water. Wipe to dry with kimwipe<br />
19) Repeat all steps for a second replica<br />
20) If the difference of algae cells density between the duplicates is to high repeat all&nbsp;steps for the third replica. Don&rsquo;t count more than 4 replicates.</span></p>
