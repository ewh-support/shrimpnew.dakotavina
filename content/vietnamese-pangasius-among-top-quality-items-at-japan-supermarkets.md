<p><span style="font-size:14px">Keisuke Hino, who manages AEON&rsquo;s aquatic products section in the northern Kanto and Niigata region, said to meet TopValu standards, products must satisfy consumers&rsquo; taste and be produced in line with AEON&rsquo;s strict process.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The Vietnamese&nbsp;pangasius product made following the recipe of the eel dish &ndash; a traditional food of Japan in the summer &ndash; is being sold at AEON supermarkets since June, and the retailing group plans to expand the sale of this product in the future, he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Tạ Đức Minh, trade counsellor and chief representative of Việt Nam&rsquo;s Industry and Trade Ministry in Japan, said the country&rsquo;s&nbsp;pangasius exports to Japan were some US$14 million in 2016 and $7 million in the first five months of 2017.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">To boost shipments of&nbsp;pangasius to Japan, it was very important to ensure food safety and align fish farming, packaging and labeling activities with Japanese standards, he added.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Aside from&nbsp;pangasius, bananas, mangoes and red-flesh dragon fruits are considered strategic goods helping to increase the two countries&rsquo; trade revenue.&nbsp;</span></p>
