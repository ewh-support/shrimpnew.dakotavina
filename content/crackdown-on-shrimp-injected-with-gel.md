<p><span style="font-size:14px">Phạm Tiến Dũng, chief inspector of the ministry&rsquo;s specialized inspection unit, said the National Agro-Forestry-Fisheries Quality Assurance Department had found many cases of gel injections into shrimps in the past several months.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">On September 7, an inspection team in the southern province of Bạc Li&ecirc;u found that a local shrimp trading business injected a liquid made of CMC (Carboxymethyl cellulose)&nbsp;powder.&nbsp;The business, owned by Đo&agrave;n Văn Phục of &nbsp;Đ&ocirc;ng Hải District&rsquo;s Long Điền Commune, hired workers to inject the liquid into more than 63 kilogrammes of shrimps. More than 9 kilogrammes of CMC and tools such as needles were seized.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">The NAFIQAD reported surprise inspections at 11 shrimp trading businesses in C&agrave; Mau and Ki&ecirc;n Giang had found three that injected the chemical into shrimp.&nbsp;The businesses were fined VNĐ200 million ($8,800), each.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Early last month, a business in H&agrave; Nội&rsquo;s Ho&agrave;ng Mai District was caught injecting the gel into 8 kilos of shrimp. L&ecirc; Quang Long, the business owner, admitted the violation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Since last year, the departments of agriculture and rural development have inspected more than 10,300 firms and found that 1,107 conducted the gel injection into shrimp. They were fined up to VND2.4 billion ($105,600) in total.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Violators admitted that each gramme of CMC is sold at about VNĐ28,000 ($1.20). Three grams of the powder can be made into 50 kilos of liquid, which can be used for one tonne of shrimp.</span></p>
