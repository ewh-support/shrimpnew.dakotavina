<h1><strong>Abstract:</strong></h1>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Outbreaks of acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND), commonly known as &quot;early mortality syndrome&quot; (EMS), caught the entire shrimp industry, the academe and the government sectors by surprise, and it took a long while to unravel its mystery because the disease broke through all biosecurity measures. While the industry has been dealing with vibriosis in all phases of culture for decades, nobody thought that a&nbsp;<em>Vibrio</em>&nbsp;would become an industry game-changer. The disease calls for a combination of basic, new and innovative strategies in biosecurity and control, and since the pathogen is ubiquitous in the environment, an exclusion strategy may not be possible. Sharing the responsibility among the government, academe and producer sectors has become essential. The &quot;First International Technical Seminar/Workshop: EMS/AHPND - Government, scientist and farmer responses&quot; was held in Panama City from 22-24 June 2015. The &quot;Second International Technical Seminar/Workshop on AHPND: There is a way forward&quot; was held in Bangkok from 23-25 June 2016. The Bangkok AHPND 2016 is also the 3rd international event organized by FAO on EMS/AHPND; the first one was held in Hanoi, Viet Nam from 25-27 June 2013 (Hanoi EMS/AHPND June 2013, see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3422e/i3422e00.htm" target="_blank">http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3422e/i3422e00.htm</a>). This document presents the abstracts of presentations delivered in Bangkok in June 2016.</p>
