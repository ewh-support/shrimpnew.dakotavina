<p><span style="font-size:16px">The method of exploration study has done by observing the water quality include the content of organic matter (TOM); total bacteria and vibrio; the stability of the plankton and identification species of bacteria in diseased shrimp. Control measures carried out by the improvement of water quality by controlling the organic matter, maintain the stability of the plankton and application of probiotics to balance C,N,P ratio. Fasting techniques and applications of natural antibiotic feed additive from garlic extract (alicyn) and vitamins to increase the effectiveness of the material to the digestive shrimp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:16px">The results showed that shrimp white feces disease there are several in the intestinum are species of bacteria Vibrio alginolyticus, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio vulnificus. Pond water contains vibrio bacteria dominance more than 12% of the total bacteria. Tottal and organic matter (TOM) more than 250 ppm. Fasting technique, alicyn and vitamins application, controlling vibrio dominance less than 10% with the application probiotics well as the disposal of sludge pond bottom and water changes to reduce content of organic matter could be for prevent disease. Ponds production be maintained on the survival rate of &gt; 70% with average daily growth rate (ADG) 0.11-0.25 g.</span></p>
