<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Here are a few of my observations on the feeding behavior of&nbsp;<em>Penaeus vannamei:</em></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">1. In some&nbsp;old Purina nutrition studies, I watched 40-gram broodstock clear newly hatched&nbsp;<em>Artemia</em>&nbsp;nauplii out of 120 L glass aquaria in a matter of minutes. &nbsp;The broodstock&rsquo;s oral appendages paddled a stream of entrained&nbsp;<em>Artemia</em>&nbsp;nauplii right into their mouths. &nbsp;The consumed (red yoked) nauplii moved through the broodstock&rsquo;s digestive track in as little as six minutes and were deposited as red fecal strands.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">The nutritional effectiveness of this type of hydraulic feeding seems dubious since there aren&rsquo;t many if any digestive processes quick enough to breakdown the nauplii and release and absorb the nutrients into the gut. &nbsp;However, if the shrimp&rsquo;s gastric mill is physically crushing the&nbsp;<em>Artemia</em>&nbsp;nauplii and releasing the yoke lipids and other inner liquids, there may be some direct absorption of these nutrients by the gut&mdash;even in six minutes.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Shrimp are&nbsp;autocoprophagous&nbsp;(consume their feces). &nbsp;They eat their fecal strands that, in this case, contained&nbsp;<em>Artemia</em>&nbsp;nauplii remains glued together with the shrimps gut mucous, digestive enzyme secretions and endogenous gut bacteria.&nbsp; Once deposited in the water, the fecal strands attract a nutritious coating of indigenous environmental bacteria. &nbsp;Consequently, the strands are probably more nutritious and easier to digest than the original feeds.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Our observational conclusion was (and mine remains) that&nbsp;<em>P. vannamei</em>&nbsp;has no difficulty at any life stage size (PL to sexually maturity) capturing and consuming relatively small&nbsp;<em>(Artemia</em>&nbsp;nauplii sizes and up) organisms&mdash;even at very low organism or feed particulate densities.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">2. We fertilized and intentionally encouraged brown diatom blooms in the Purina ponds and occasionally surveyed the pond bottoms for benthic organisms, finding almost none.&nbsp; Those that remained were hiding under debris, rocks, shells and liner folds to avoid the ravenous shrimp.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Since we found that these conditions persisted from nursery to pre-harvest shrimp, our conclusion was the shrimp were very efficient predators and that it would be impossible to initiate and sustain significant zooplankton organisms without culturing them separately and &ldquo;feeding&rdquo; the pond with the cultured organisms.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">These ponds were diatom bloom dominated and were receiving exchanges of 2-4 mm filtered (sea water, Gulf of Mexico) at about 10% per day. &nbsp;So the ponds were receiving a relatively constant resupply of whatever zooplankton was in the incoming water.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Based on our observation, under our conditions and in our specific ponds, we believed that zooplankton and benthic organisms are an important part of the shrimp&rsquo;s nutrition in newly stocked ponds, but since they are so quickly depleted from the pond and do not reappear in significant numbers thereafter, they do not represent a significant portion of the shrimps overall nutrition. &nbsp;This reasoning regarding live food nutrition contributions was also supported by numerous observations of non-fed and or fertilized only shrimp production systems of the time that seemed limited to producing about 400-500 kilograms per hectare, but sometimes reaching as high as 800 kg/ha with good fertilization strategies.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">3. Also, in previous posts, several of us long time&nbsp;<em>vannamei</em>&nbsp;observers have noted that today&rsquo;s strains of&nbsp;<em>vannamei</em>&nbsp;seem to spend much more time up in the water column than earlier less domesticated strains&mdash;especially in biofloc systems.</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">We believe the increased use of the water column is the result of:</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&bull; Increased water circulation, which aids swimming.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&bull; More feed in the water column.&nbsp; Formulated feeds are fed more frequently&nbsp;and bioflocs are loaded with stuff that shrimp like to eat.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&bull; Consequently, there has been selective pressure for strains that adapt&nbsp;to life up in the water column.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">There is no doubt that shrimp have strong feed preferences, and prefer specific live feeds over most if not all commercial pelleted feed. &nbsp;However, with the increased costs of land, labor and energy in most places, it is difficult to justify economically/competitively the resources to produce, maintain and manage in-pond (low-density shrimp production) or separate live feed cultures of sufficient scale for cost efficient and competitive commercial shrimp production.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-left:0in; margin-right:0in; text-align:left"><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">&nbsp;</span></span></span><span style="font-size:14px"><span style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#000000">Additionally, as management technology and formulated feeds have improved, the quality and health differences between live-food-produced shrimp and formulated-feed-produced shrimp have diminished, if not disappeared in the case of the best feeds. &nbsp;We believe this trend will continue technologically and economically.</span></span></span></p>
