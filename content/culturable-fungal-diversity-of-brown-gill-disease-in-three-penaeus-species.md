<p>A totally 6&nbsp;genera of 20 species from 427 colonies were isolated from the samples. The maximum growth of colonies was occurred at 80th&nbsp;day of sampling. Microscopical and pathological studies revealed that the fungal infection on gill. Hence the present&nbsp;investigation revealed that poor water quality conditions are a budding problem and due to this factor diseased shrimps are &nbsp;to be frail for consumption.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Introduction&nbsp;</strong><br />
Shrimp grown in captivity are liable to diseases caused by &nbsp;microorganisms and this dramatically affects productivity. Penaideae is a common shrimp family used in nurseries by Indians. The culture of various species of shrimp has an &nbsp;economical importance in many parts of the world as well&nbsp;as in India. One of the problems facing the culture of&nbsp;shrimp farming is widespread&nbsp;diseases which lead to heavy losses to industry. The shrimp diseases caused by some factors such as microbes,&nbsp;culture environments and feed,&nbsp;also influence the success of shrimp culture&nbsp;<br />
The&nbsp;microbiological contamination of species may arise from&nbsp;sources, such as indigenous microflora of plants and&nbsp;animals,microorganisms present in processing plant, air,&nbsp;post harvest contamination from dust, use of contaminated&nbsp;water and by human contact. Microbial communities are of&nbsp;primary importance in all the biological activities&nbsp;</p>
