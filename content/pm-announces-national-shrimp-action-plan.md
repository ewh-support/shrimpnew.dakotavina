<p><span style="font-size:14px">According to the action plan, Vietnam&rsquo;s shrimp export value will increase&nbsp;to approximately $5.5 billion based on an average annual growth rate of 0.79% during the 2017-2020 period. The total area used for rearing brackish water shrimp is estimated to reach 710,000 hectares, with a total output of 850,000 metric tons of shrimp.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">During the 2021-2025 period, Vietnam will develop a more&nbsp;hi-tech shrimp industry and large-scale eco-shrimp farming areas in Bạc Li&ecirc;u province. Subsequently, the shrimp industry expects to hit $10bn in export value based on an average growth of 12.7% per year. Total area used for rearing brackish water shrimp is expected to expand to 750,000ha and 1.1 million metric tons of output in the period. The southern province of Bạc Li&ecirc;u should focus on super intensive,&nbsp;high-tech shrimp farming to become&nbsp;the&nbsp;nation&rsquo;s&nbsp;shrimp&nbsp;hub, Prime Minister Nguyễn Xu&acirc;n Ph&uacute;c&nbsp;told an&nbsp;investment conference in Bạc Li&ecirc;u City on Jan 30.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">&ldquo;The shrimp industry would be the answer for the development of several provinces in the Mekong Delta, including Bạc Li&ecirc;u. Fishing, aquaculture, seafood processing, renewable energy like wind and solar, and tourism are&nbsp;the&nbsp;strengths&nbsp;of the province and need to be promoted. Agriculture accounts for nearly half the province&rsquo;s GDP and local authorities should focus on production of high-quality rice, he said. &ldquo;However,&nbsp;a&nbsp;proper&nbsp;zoning&nbsp;plan is very crucial&nbsp;because if relevant authorities choose the right locations, it would help harness all the potential.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">He&nbsp;said&nbsp;the province should&nbsp;focus on improving the business environment and establish&nbsp;close links&nbsp;with&nbsp;the rest of the&nbsp;Mekong Delta, especially with neighbouring provinces like C&agrave; Mau, Ki&ecirc;n Giang, and S&oacute;c Trăng,&nbsp;and&nbsp;with&nbsp;HCM&nbsp;City&nbsp;with respect to&nbsp;both production and consumption. It should apply the climate change model in shrimp farming to take advantage of the weather and market demand.</span></p>
