<p><span style="font-size:14px">&bull;Ovaprim is a ready to use product and the solution is stable at ambient temperature.<br />
&bull;It contains an analogue of 20 &mu;g of Salmon gonadotropin releasing hormone (sGnPHa) and a dopamine antagonsist, domperidone at 10 mg/ml.<br />
&bull;The potency of ovaprim is uniform and contains sGnRHa which is known to be 17 times more potent than LHRH (Peter, 1987).<br />
&bull;Ovaprim being a ready to use product and one which does not require refrigerated storage, appears to be the most convenient and effective ovulating agent.<br />
&bull;This drug is administered to both female and male brood fish simultaneously in a single dose, unlike pituitary extract which is given in two split doses.<br />
&bull;The efficiency of ovaprim for induced breeding of carps have given highly encouraging results in catla, rohu, mrigal, silver carp, grass carp, big head carp etc.<br />
&bull;The common dose for all carps is 0.10-0.20 ml ovaprim / kg body weight of males and 0.25-0.80 ml ovaprim / kg body weight of females.<br />
&bull;Female catla is found to respond positively for a dose range of between 0.4-0.5 ml/kg, while rohu and mrigal respond to lower doses of 0.35 ml / kg and 0.25 ml / kg respectively.<br />
&bull;Among exotic carps, silver carp and grass carp are bred at doses ranging between 0.40-0.60 ml / kg. Big head carp bred successfully at 0.50 ml / kg. For males of Indian carps; 0.10-0.15 ml / kg and for exotic male carps 0.15-0.20 ml / kg of dosages are found to be optimum.<br />
&bull; Female Koi, Shing and Gusha dose appeared to be: 0.20mg/kg and in case of male dose appeared to be: 0.10mg/kg fish.<br />
&bull;The method of injection is the same as pituitary gland extract.<br />
&bull;Ovaprim has unique advantages over pituitary hormone &ndash; ready to use liquid form in 10 ml vial, consistent potency and reliable results, long shelf life, and can be stored at room temperature, formulated to prevent over dosing, male and female can be injected only once simultaneously, reduces handling and post breeding mortality, repeated spawning possible later in the season and high percentage of eggs, fertilization and hatching.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">This reduces the handling of brood fish but also helps in saving considerable amount of time and labour which will add on to the cost of seed production.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:14px">Note: Mentioned rate of dose may vary as per maturity,health and environmental contentions.</span></p>
