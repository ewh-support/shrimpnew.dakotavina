<p>Thus, it is important to study the relationships between aquatic animals and bacterial communities. Here, bacterial communities associated with&nbsp;<em>Litopenaeus vannamei</em>&nbsp;larvae at different healthy statuses (diseased and healthy) and growth stages (i.e., zoea, mysis, and early postlarvae periods) were examined using 454-pyrosequencing of the 16S rRNA gene.</p>

<p>Bacterial communities with significant difference were observed between healthy and diseased rearing water, and several bacterial groups, such as genera&nbsp;<em>Nautella</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Kordiimonas</em>&nbsp;could also distinguish healthy and diseased shrimp.&nbsp;<em>Rhodobacteraceae</em>&nbsp;was widely distributed in rearing water at all growth stages but there were several stage-specific groups, indicating that bacterial members in rearing water assembled into distinct communities throughout the larval development. However,&nbsp;<em>Gammaproteobacteria</em>, mainly family&nbsp;<em>Enterobacteriaceae</em>, was the most abundant group (accounting for more than 85%) in shrimp larvae at all growth stages.</p>

<p>This study compared bacterial communities associated with healthy and diseased&nbsp;<em>L</em>.&nbsp;<em>vannamei</em>&nbsp;larvae and rearing water, and identified several health- and growth stage-specific bacterial groups, which might be provided as indicators for monitoring the healthy status of shrimp larvae in hatchery.</p>
